Kazakh student in Europe

A short introduction about myself: I am a 4th-year student at a girls-only university in Almaty. This year, I will complete my bachelor’s degree and receive my diploma. My future profession is physics. I am 22 years old. My parents live in another city, and I have two younger brothers.My hobbies include reading books and watching movies. So far, I have read around 35–40 books. My favorite one from world literature is “Robinson Crusoe.” I also enjoy traveling and organizing tours. Up to now, I have visited 9 countries.





I am a beginner web developer exploring how the web works — from structuring pages with HTML to bringing them alive with CSS and JavaScript.
My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer capable of building modern, user-friendly applications.
