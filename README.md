I am a beginner web developer exploring how the web works — from structuring pages with HTML to bringing them alive with CSS and JavaScript.
My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer capable of building modern, user-friendly applications.

🚀 Skills I’m Building

*HTML5 — semantic markup, forms, tables, lists
*CSS3 — layouts, responsiveness, styling basics
*JavaScript — functions, events, interactivity
*Version Control — beginner Git & GitHub workflow

🛠 Current Focus

Right now, I am working on a mini web project, learning how to combine HTML, CSS, and JS into a functional web page.
More updates coming soon...

📘 Course Progress

*Completed HTML basic modules
*Practicing CSS modifications
*Experimenting with JavaScript events
*Building small code examples
